Credit Default Prediction using Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forest)
This project builds a Credit Default Prediction model using the Kaggle bank loans dataset with features like age, education, employment, income, debt ratio, and credit history to classify the target variable default (0/1). Data was preprocessed with scaling and train-test split, followed by training three models: Logistic Regression (baseline), Support Vector Classifier (non-linear separation), and Random Forest (ensemble for feature importance and accuracy). Confusion matrices, cross-validation, and GridSearchCV were used to evaluate and tune models. Results showed Random Forest performing best, especially in reducing false negatives, which is critical in credit risk analysis. The project demonstrates an end-to-end ML pipeline: data exploration → preprocessing → training → tuning → evaluation, and highlights practical trade-offs in financial risk modeling
